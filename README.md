# User Authentication System

This is a simple yet essential project for creating/handling authentication process and how it is done in a project with all the steps behind the scenes.

## Backend

For the backend I use node.js, express.js, passport.js, mongoose.js, mongodb, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken.

## Frontend

I use React.js with tailwind.js for styling and axios for making HTTP requests.
